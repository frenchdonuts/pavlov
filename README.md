#Pavlov

Pavlov is an app to help with your motivation. Set the due date and the initial priority, and watch the priority bubble up as you procrastinate. Swipe the task away once you've completed it. This was a toy project I refactored to see how MVVM and rxJava could be used on Android, but now takes it's architectural cues from reframe(a frontend clojurescript library).
