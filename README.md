#Pavlov

Pavlov is an app to help with your motivation. Set the due date and the initial priority, and watch the priority bubble up as you procrastinate. Swipe the task away once you've completed it. This is a toy project I refactored to see how MVVM and rxJava could be used on Android.

##Todo
* Fix animation glitch upon dismissal of task
* Write tests
* Dismiss keyboard upon clicking the add button
* Refactor some views to use the new Google design support library
